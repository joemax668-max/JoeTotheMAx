			<p>Game of Thrones" is based on George R.R. Martin's series "A Song of Ice and Fire," which draws heavily from historical events, political intrigue, and medieval themes.
Literary Roots
A Song of Ice and Fire: The series began with the publication of "A Game of Thrones" in 1996, which was the first book in the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series by George R.R. Martin. Martin's work was inspired by his background in writing for television and his interest in fantasy literature, leading to a complex narrative filled with political intrigue and morally ambiguous characters.</p>

			<p>A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of high fantasy novels by the American author George R. R. Martin. Martin began writing the first volume, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, and published it in 1996. Martin, who originally envisioned the series as a trilogy, has released five out of seven planned volumes. The most recent entry in the series, A Dance with Dragons, was published in 2011. Martin plans to write the sixth novel, titled The Winds of Winter. A seventh novel, A Dream of Spring, is planned to follow.

A Song of Ice and Fire depicts a violent world dominated by political realism. What little supernatural power exists is confined to the margins of the known world. Moral ambiguity pervades the books, and many of the storylines frequently raise questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence. The story unfolds through an alternating set of subjective points of view, the success or survival of any of which is never assured. Each chapter is told from a limited third-person perspective, drawn from a group of characters that expands from nine in the first novel to 31 by the fifth.

The novels are set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos (the world as a whole does not have an established name). Martin's stated inspirations for the series include the Wars of the Roses and The Accursed Kings, a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon.[3][4] The work as a whole consists of three interwoven plots: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the ambition of the surviving members of the dethroned Targaryen dynasty to return from their exile in Essos and reassume the Iron Throne, and the growing threat posed by the powerful supernatural Others from the northernmost region of Westeros.

As of 2015, more than 90 million copies in 47 languages had been sold.[5][6][7] The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller lists when published in 2005 and 2011 respectively.[8] Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, two television series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games. The series has received critical acclaim for its world-building, characters, and narrative.</p>
